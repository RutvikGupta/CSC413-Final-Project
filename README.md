## Repo Structure:
- `SOA_Models.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook consists of the code for state-of-the-art models comparison experiment where we defined their 
architectures and trained and evaluated them on the COCO dataset.

- `UNet Experiments.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook consists of the code for UNet model complexity experiment where we defined their 
architectures and trained and evaluated them on the COCO dataset.

- `Result/`: The directory consists of the results of the experiments.
